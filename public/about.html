            <h1>About this Website</h1>

            <p>This website was created using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. The chat functionality was made possible with the use of <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a>, and <a href="https://socket.io/">Socket.io</a>. The server is run on a <a href="https://www.codio.com/blog/codio-boxes-and-box-parts">Codio box</a> using <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/">Ubuntu 18.04 LTS</a>. &#128039;</p>

                <h3>Styling &#127872;</h3>
                <p>The website has been designed with consistency in mind, with a common use of rounded corners throughout the pages to reflect modern design patterns. Great detail has been taken into ensuring the padding of the website remains consistent on both larger and smaller screens.</p>
                <p>The chat page has been carefully designed to make different elements visible and distinguishable. The outgoing and incoming messages are positioned on opposite sides of the page and are of different colours. The message alerts are separated from the main conversation by their placement in the centre of the chat, while the typing notification is a soft grey colour to represent its temporary presence.</p>

                <h3>Chat Usernames &#128219;</h3>
                <p>The chat usernames are a randomly selected string of adjectives, nouns, and emojis, generated by the JavaScript back-end. These memorable phrases make the chat easy to follow and fun to use! However, due to it being randomly generated, I am not responsible for any...unfortunate combination of words.</p>

                <p><u>Why the Emojis? &#129300;</u></p>
                <p>They make buttons easier to find, and are fun!</p>

                <p><u>Why do you not have Bootstrap? &#128559;</u></p>
                <p>I was able to provide the functionality I needed with my own CSS. Including Bootstrap might have affected some of these careful customisations.</p> 
                
                <p><u>Do you have any pets? &#128570;</u></p>
                <p>I have two adorable rabbits, Charlie and Snoopy! (Named after the characters of the famous Peanuts comic strip)</p>
